# Wordle

This project is from UNC Chapel Hill's COMP 110: Introduction to Programming and Data Science course, taken in Fall 2023 with Dr. Alyssa Lytle. When this game is run in the terminal, it replicates the New York Times' word game.

#### Gameplay:
This game takes a user's input of exactly five letters and returns a string of emojis in the terminal based on the correctness of the guess. The user may guess up to 6 times with continuous feedback from the program. Game specific instructions can be found on the New York Times' Wordle site.

#### Tech Stack:
This project was created using VSCode and Python.

#### Takeaways:
This project allowed me to implement the Python skills that I had learned in Comp110. This game also makes use of the terminal and was a great introduction to game design.
